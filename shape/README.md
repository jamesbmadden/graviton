# Graviton Shape
Shape Web Component Designed By James Madden, Loosely following the Material Spec.

## Install
```
npm install @graviton/shape
```

Import the component into your app:
```js
import '@graviton/shape';
```
To use your own build process on the component, import
```js
import '@graviton/shape/src/gvt-shape.js';
```

## Usage

To use Graviton Shape in html:
```html
<gvt-shape></gvt-shape>
```

## Compatibility

Graviton Shape's default bundle should be compatible with the latest 2 versions of evergreen browsers, as well as IE 11. To build with different browser requirements, or to build a modern es2015 bundle, use the unbundled import (`import '@graviton/shape/src/gvt-shape.js'`) and your own build process.
